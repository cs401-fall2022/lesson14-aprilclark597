    <h2>- for JavaScript Programmers</h2><br>
    <div>
      <p>
        If you're new to TypeScript, we can think of this new tool as a layer on
        top of JavaScript that enforces strict types. TypeScript knows the JavaScript
        language and will generate types for you in many cases. For example in creating a
        variable and assigning it to a particular value, TypeScript will use the value as its type.
        You may have written JavaScript in Visual Studio Code, and had editor auto-completion.
        Visual Studio Code uses TypeScript under the hood to make it easier to work with JavaScript.
        <br> <br>TypeScript is a bit unusual as a language in that it neither runs in an interpreter
        (as Python and Ruby do) nor compiles down to a lower-level language (as Java and C do).
        Instead, it compiles to another high-level language, JavaScript. It is this JavaScript that
        runs, not your TypeScript. So TypeScript’s relationship with JavaScript is essential, but it
        can also be a source of confusion. Understanding this relationship will help you be a more
        effective TypeScript developer.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <div>
        <h3 id="types">TYPES</h3>
        <p>TypeScript is a <strong>superset</strong> of JavaScript. In other words, all JavaScript programs are already
          TypeScript programs. TypeScript has some syntax of its own, so TypeScript programs are not,
          in general, valid JavaScript programs.<br><br>TypeScript adds a type system that models
          JavaScript’s runtime behavior and tries to spot code which will throw exceptions at runtime.
          But you shouldn’t expect it to flag every exception. It is possible for code to pass the
          type checker but still throw at runtime.<br><br>While TypeScript’s type system largely
          models JavaScript behavior, there are some constructs that JavaScript allows but TypeScript
          chooses to bar, such as calling functions with the wrong number of arguments.
          This is largely a matter of taste.<br><br>TypeScript makes developers lives easier by enforcing strict
          types.
          JavaScript provides language primitives like string and
          number, but it doesn’t check that you’ve consistently assigned them.
          TypeScript does this for us! This means that an existing JavaScript code
          is not wasted - it is also TypeScript code. The main benefit of TypeScript is that it can
          highlight unexpected behavior in your code, lowering the chance of bugs.
        </p>
        <p class="code"><br>let <span class="var">helloWorld</span> <span class="oper">=</span> <span
            class="string">"Hello World!"</span><br><br>
        </p>
        <p>Typescript recognizes the text as a string, and sets the variable helloWorld to type string.</p>
        <br><br>

      <br><br>
      <h3 id="definingTypes">DEFINING TYPES</h3>
      <p>
        You can use a wide variety of design patterns in JavaScript. However, some design patterns make it
        difficult for types to be inferred automatically (for example, patterns that use dynamic programming).
        To cover these cases, TypeScript supports an extension of the JavaScript language, which offers places
        for you to tell TypeScript what the types should be.
        For example, to create an object with an inferred type which includes name: string and id: number, you can
        write:
      <p class="code"><br>
        <span class="define">const</span> <span class="var">user</span> <span class="oper">= {</span>
        name: <span class="string">"April"</span>,
        id: 4
        <span class="oper">, };</span>
        <br><br>
      </p>
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <h3 id="runtime">RUNTIME BEHAVIOR</h3>
      <p id="third">
        TypeScript is also a programming language that preserves the runtime behavior of JavaScript.
        For example, dividing by zero in JavaScript produces Infinity instead of throwing a runtime exception.
        As a principle, TypeScript never changes the runtime behavior of JavaScript code.
        This means that if you move code from JavaScript to TypeScript, it is guaranteed to run the same way,
        even if TypeScript thinks that the code has type errors.
        Keeping the same runtime behavior as JavaScript is a foundational promise of TypeScript because it
        means you can easily transition between the two languages without worrying about subtle differences
        that might make your program stop working.
        <br><br>
      </p>
      <p>TypeScript’s type system models the runtime behavior of JavaScript. This may result in some surprises if you’re
        coming from a language with stricter runtime checks. For example:</p>
      <p class="code">
        <br><span class="define">const </span><span class="var">x</span> <span class="oper">=</span> 2 <span
          class="oper">+</span> <span class="string">'3'</span><span class="oper">;</span>
        <span class="comments">// type is string
        </span>
        <br>
        <span class="define">const </span><span class="var">y</span> <span class="oper">=</span> <span
          class="string">'2'</span> <span class="oper">+</span> 3<span class="oper">;</span>
        <span class="comments">// type is string</span><br><br>
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <div>
        <h3 id="functions">FUNCTIONS</h3>
        <p>Functions are the basic building block of any application, whether they’re local functions,
          imported from another module, or methods on a class. They’re also values, and just like
          other values, TypeScript has many ways to describe how functions can be called.
          Let’s learn about how to write types that describe functions.<br>
          The simplest way to describe a function is with a function type expression.
          These types are syntactically similar to arrow functions:
        </p>
        <div>
          <div><img class="codeImage" src="functioncode.png" alt="Function code"></div>
          <p>The syntax (a: string) => void means “a function with one parameter, named a, of type
            string, that doesn’t have a return value”. Just like with function declarations, if a
            parameter type isn’t specified, it’s implicitly any.</p>
          <p>Of course, we can use a type alias to name a function type:</p>
          <div><img class="codeImage" src="greeter.png" alt="greeter function"></div>
        </div>
      </div>
