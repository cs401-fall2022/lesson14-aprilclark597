    <h2>- for JavaScript Programmers</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        If you're new to TypeScript, we can think of this new tool as a layer on
        top of JavaScript that enforces strict types. TypeScript knows the JavaScript 
        language and will generate types for you in many cases. For example in creating a 
        variable and assigning it to a particular value, TypeScript will use the value as its type.
        You may have written JavaScript in Visual Studio Code, and had editor auto-completion. 
        Visual Studio Code uses TypeScript under the hood to make it easier to work with JavaScript.
      </p>

      <h3>TYPES</h3>
      <p>
        TypeScript makes developers lives easier by enforcing strict types. 
        JavaScript provides language primitives like string and
        number, but it doesn’t check that you’ve consistently assigned them.
        TypeScript does this for us! This means that an existing JavaScript code
        is not wasted - it is also TypeScript code. The main benefit of TypeScript is that it can
        highlight unexpected behavior in your code, lowering the chance of bugs.
      </p>
      <p class="code"><br>let helloWorld = "Hello World!"<br><br></p>
      <p>Typescript recognizes the text as a string, and sets the variable helloWorld to type string.</p>

      <br><br>
      <h3>DEFINING TYPES</h3>
      <p>
        You can use a wide variety of design patterns in JavaScript. However, some design patterns make it 
        difficult for types to be inferred automatically (for example, patterns that use dynamic programming).
        To cover these cases, TypeScript supports an extension of the JavaScript language, which offers places 
        for you to tell TypeScript what the types should be.
        For example, to create an object with an inferred type which includes name: string and id: number, you can write:
        <p class="code"><br>
          const user = {
            name: "April",
            id: 4,
          };
        <br><br></p>
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <h3>RUNTIME BEHAVIOR</h3>
      <p id = "third">
        TypeScript is also a programming language that preserves the runtime behavior of JavaScript. 
        For example, dividing by zero in JavaScript produces Infinity instead of throwing a runtime exception. 
        As a principle, TypeScript never changes the runtime behavior of JavaScript code.
        This means that if you move code from JavaScript to TypeScript, it is guaranteed to run the same way, 
        even if TypeScript thinks that the code has type errors.
        Keeping the same runtime behavior as JavaScript is a foundational promise of TypeScript because it 
        means you can easily transition between the two languages without worrying about subtle differences 
        that might make your program stop working.
